Easy plugin which limits WooCommerce free shipping to continental U.S.

== Description ==

This plugin, when activated, modifies the default WooCommerce Free Shipping *when limited to the United States* to exclude Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico.  Customers in those states/territories will no longer be presented with a free shipping option.  Only cutomers in the continental United States will be able to select free shipping.

PLEASE NOTE: THIS PLUGIN IS OFFERED WITHOUT WARRANTEES AND GUARANTEES.  It is good practice to test plugin additions to any WooCommerce store in a development environment and not on a live site to ensure there are no conflicts with other plugins and that they work as expected.  While this plugin at its current version is tested within the most recent versions of WordPress and WooCommerce, and shown to disable free shipping from customers outside of the continental U.S., WooCommerce and WordPress versions (+ additional plugins/addons) and subsequent compatibility may vary. WE ARE NOT LIABLE for shipping charges in the case of incorrectly applied free shipping.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the unzipped plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Make sure you have Free Shipping enabled in your WooCommerce Settings and that it is limited to the United States.
4. That's all! No plugin configuration necessary.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with other WordPress shopping carts? =

No. This plugin only works with WooCommerce.

= Do I have to enable free shipping in WooCommerce?  =

Yes. This plugin only modifies the output of WooCommerce free shipping.  If free shipping is not enabled in WooCommerce, then it will not work. 

= Do I have to limit free shipping to the United States in WooCommerce? =

Yes!  All this plugin does is remove free shipping for customers in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico.  If you do not limit free shipping to the United States and enable this plugin, free shipping will be available to everyone in the world except the four places previously mentioned.  This plugin works IN TANDEM with the WooCommerce setting.

= What happens if a customer is outside the continental United States? =

Customers outside of the continental United States will be shown all other activated shipping methods except for free shipping.  If you do not have any other shipping methods enabled, these customers will not be able to proceed with checkout.
